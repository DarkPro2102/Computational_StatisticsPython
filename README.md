# Computational Statistics Python
 
I've created these codes to implement statistics knowledge in Python for the [**Computational Statistics with Python course at Platzi**](https://platzi.com/clases/programacion-estocastica/).

## The scripts are:
* Probabilidades: Which returns the probability of getting a specific number given a number of attempts of rolling dices. 
* media: Provides methods to determine the mean value, standard deviation and variance of a given array of numbers. 
* Fibonacci: Calculates the fibonacci number using recursive method and dynamic method. 
* Calculo_pi: Calls media script and estimates the value of pi using the montecarlo method. 
* Barajas: Creates random deck for a poker game and determined the probability of getting an even deck 

## Instructions
* You can run this code on the terminal, or open the source code in your code editor. 
* You can also use the main methods for testing.
